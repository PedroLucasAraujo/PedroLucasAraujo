# Hello, I'm Pedro Lucas Araujo

Passionate about the most cutting-edge web and mobile development technologies.

I embarked on my programming journey at the age of 15 through the M3 Academy professional course. Since then, I've been a part of the M3 family, starting as a Junior during high school and advancing to a Full Stack Developer. My experience spans international projects, where I've engaged with technologies such as React, TypeScript, Node.js, and GraphQL.

Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Analysis and Systems Development at CEFET/RJ.
