Enthusiast of the Best Web & Mobile Development Technologies

At the age of 15, I began my training in the field, and my outstanding performance during this period earned me a unique opportunity: I was hired as a developer at a multinational company while still in school. Now, with several years of experience, I have expanded my knowledge and skills, enabling me to become an even more well-rounded developer. I actively participate in international projects, directly engage with clients, and implement complex solutions.

Currently, I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Analysis and Systems Development at CEFET/RJ.
